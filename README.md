Forked from [Parth/dotfiles](https://github.com/Parth/dotfiles).
The original developer also made a great video detailing and demonstrating the setup and configuration for this project which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UgDz_9i2nwc).

## Installation
Once the repo is cloned, run the following to pull down all the submodules.
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## tmux
Ctrl-B has been remapped to &#96;.
If you want to type to actual &#96; character itself, just hit the key twice.
